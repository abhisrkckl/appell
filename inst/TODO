   "It can be of interest for statistics, as the functions of this paper, which
   are Coulomb wave functions, are products of simple functions and of the 1F1
   and 2F0 confluent hypergeometric functions, used in statistics. It would be
   then simple to wrap CWFCOMPLEX into 1F1 and 2F0 routines."
