	* A bunch of Fortran code modifications necessary to survive the
	pedantic compiler flags.

	* Replace "write" and "format" calls in Fortran with R-compatible
	calls, so that no warnings or notes appear in R CMD check.

	* Move ChangeLog file to inst directory to have it installed in
	the library.

	* TODO: Add CWFCOMPLEX reference.

	* Finished first pre-release version. The code by Michel and
	Stoitsov is used as default, because it does not produce NAs in
	the examples.

	* I now got the permission by the CPC program library and all
	authors to use their code in this package. Therefore start to
	include the code by Michel and Stoitsov and add an option to the
	appellf1 function to decide between the Gaussian hypergeometric
	function algorithms. Also add direct R functions for the complex
	Gaussian hypergeometric function.

	* Remove Numerical Recipes code for the hypergeometric function
	and instead work with the code by R. Forrey (chyp.f). This
	produces more NAs in the examples, but is not proprietary code and
	also removes a Fortran compiler warning.

	Consider replacing this code with newer one by N. Michel and M. V.
	Stoitsov (2008, Comput. Phys. Commun. 178:535-551).

	* Start of the package.
